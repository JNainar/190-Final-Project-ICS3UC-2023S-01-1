Hello Mr. Penney,

We just wanted to let you know that we continued working on the game on Thursday to finish and refine the animations. We originally submitted it with incomplete animations on Thursday but later were able to work through the bugs and get it functioning properly. We chose to not focus on detailed styling, specifically mobile styling, but we completed mobile styling to the best of our ability.

Thanks,
Jumaana and Abi
